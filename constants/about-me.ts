    question: "What is Next.js, and why do you use it for web development?",
    answer:
      "Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. We use Next.js because it simplifies development with features like automatic code splitting, hot reloading, and built-in routing, ensuring high performance and a great user experience. It‚Äôs trusted by companies like Netflix and Nike for its versatility and speed",

    question: "How does your service ensure my website performs well under high traffic?",
    answer:
      "Our Next.js-based solutions leverage server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to handle high traffic efficiently. Features like Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allow content updates without full rebuilds, ensuring scalability. We also integrate with CDNs and optimize code to reduce latency, delivering fast load times even with millions of users",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Can you help me integrate my Next.js website with a headless CMS?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we specialize in integrating Next.js with headless CMS platforms like Storyblok or BCMS. This setup allows for flexible content management while maintaining fast performance through SSR and SSG. Our team ensures seamless API connections for real-time content updates, ideal for content-heavy sites like blogs or e-commerce platforms",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Is Next.js suitable for building a SaaS platform?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Next.js is ideal for SaaS platforms due to its scalability, support for API routes, and ability to handle dynamic data. However, we recommend separating frontend and backend logic for complex SaaS architectures to avoid coupling issues, ensuring maintainability and flexibility as your platform grows",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How do you handle SEO for Next.js websites?",
    answer:
      "Next.js enhances SEO through server-side rendering and static site generation, which ensure search engines can crawl and index content efficiently.

  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What are the challenges of using Next.js, and how do you address them?",
    answer:

We mitigate this by following best practices, using clear documentation, and structuring projects to minimize complexity. Our team also provides training and support to ensure smooth development and maintenance",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can I deploy my Next.js website on platforms other than Vercel?",
    answer:
