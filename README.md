# Welcome to Farzad Vahdati portfolio website

This project is my personal portfolio, built to **showcase my work and services** in a clear and professional way.  
The main sections include:

- Services
- Products
- Open-source projects (as “Lab”)
- About me
- Contact
- Quick-access landing page

The target audience includes both **consumers** (potential clients) and **developers** (collaborators or recruiters).

Since this is a minimal-scale project, I decided **not to use a database**.  
Instead, I manage static content through **TypeScript constants**.  
For CTAs, I used a simple approach by redirecting users to my **Telegram username link** for direct contact.

### Future Improvements

- Add a headless CMS

---

### 🚀 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – type safety and maintainability
- **React.js & Next.js** – modern front-end framework and SSR/SSG support
- **TailwindCSS** – utility-first styling
- **Kadoui-css, Kadoui-react** – my own UI component library
- **Lucide-react** – lightweight, flexible icons
- **Mantine-hooks** – ready-to-use React hooks
- **Framer Motion** – animations and transitions
- **Lodash** – utility functions for complex logic
- **ESLint** – static code analysis
- **Prettier** – code formatting

### 📂 Project Structure:

- components/
  └── static/
  └── Entity/Entity.tsx
- constants/
  └── entity.constant.ts
- types/
  └── entity.type.ts

This separation improves maintainability and makes it easy to scale the codebase as new features are added.
